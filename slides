Node.js in 30 minutes or less

What is Node?

---
[picture of "the hot thing"]

---
Chome? (and V8?)

---
Event Machine?

JavaScript on top of an event/callback-based system API

---
Theory: Lots of time is wasted waiting for IO

* HTTP requests to services
* Writes to disk
* Writes to DB

---
Why not just register a callback so we can keep moving?

   fs.readFile(callback)
   [add more callback examples]

---
For web this means handling many RPS even on one instance

---
Get Node.js

---
Compiling from source is straight-forward

    $ git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git
    $ cd node
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    $ make
    $ make install || sudo make install 

---
Your package manager probably calls it "node"

    $ brew install node

---
The basics

---
FILE:helloworld.js
    var sys = require('sys');
    sys.puts('hello world');

    $ node helloworld.js
    hello world

---
Asynchronous code looks different

    things.each(function(thing, next) {
      doStuffWith(i);
      next();
    });

instead of

    things.each(function(thing) {
      doStuffWith(i);
    });

[reference to event machine presentation]

---
Handling web requests

---
FILE:httpserver.js
    var http = require('http');
    
    http.createServer(function (req, res) {
      res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
      res.end('Hello world\n');
    }).listen(8000);

    $ ./nodeload.js -f -n 100000 -i 10 -c 20 http://localhost:3000/
    ... # load test on a VirtualBox VM
    Requests per second:                    1748.19

Testable?

---
Sure.
