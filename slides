Ruby has lots of calls that block the VM:

* Net::HTTP.get
* TCPSocket::gethostbyname
* IO#read

---
Leads to:

* Global interpretter lock
* Lots of ruby app instances

---
Node.js has none of that business

Leads to handling high RPS even on one instance

Get Node.js

Compiling from source is straight-forward

    $ git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git
    $ cd node
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    $ make
    $ make install || sudo make install 

---
Your package manager probably calls it "node"

    $ brew install node

---
FILE:helloworld.js
    var sys = require('sys');
    sys.puts('hello world');

    $ node helloworld.js
    hello world

---
FILE:httpserver.js
    var http = require('http');
    
    http.createServer(function (req, res) {
      res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
      res.end('Hello world\n');
    }).listen(8000);

    $ ./nodeload.js -f -n 100000 -i 10 -c 20 http://localhost:3000/
    ...
